# O365 Calendar on a Raspberry Pi and e-Ink Display

![A picture of the setup](O365CalendarPi.png)

## Motivation
I found myself frequently checking my calendar throughout the day and sometimes reserving a monitor for it. This low-cost, low-power setup saves me a tab and a couple of clicks per day!

The small screen (2.13") presents a few challenges in presenting the data. I decided to show the start time of each meeting with the duration indicated by blocks on the right hand side (1 block = 30 mins). A solid line demarcates between today and tomorrow's meetings.

## Hardware

* [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w)
* [Waveshare 2.13" e-ink display](https://thepihut.com/products/three-colour-2-13-eink-display-phat-red-black-white)
* [Case](https://thepihut.com/products/pi-zero-case-for-waveshare-2-13-eink-display)

Total cost is around Â£35

## Further Work

I would like to generalise to support other calendars and support different size displays. Contributions are very welcome.
